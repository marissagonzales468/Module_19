## Trading Algorithim Application 
This 'Trading Algorithim Application'nbased in python programming is essentially an algorithmic trading bot that learns and adapts to new data and evolving markets.Establishing a Baseline Performance to take account of risk then use real trading methodologies into the machine to help predict actual returns! The bot then creates and displays an evaluated classification report as to how accurate the bot is and what gains and losses have been made based on the strategy that was used.
## Technologies
This project leverages python 3.7 with the following packages:
 * [numpy](https://numpy.org) - Numpy provides an extensive
package of mathematcal functions, random number generators, 
and other compendious functions.
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) - For using data science/data analysis and machine learning tasks.
* [hvplot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org) - For plotting visual data and seeing a map geographically,
* [Matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/)- For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
* [scikit-learn](https://pypi.org/project/scikit-learn/)- A set of python modules for machine learning and data mining
## Installation Guide
Before running the application first install the following dependencies.

```python
  pip install pandas
  pip install numpy
  pip install hvplot
  pip install Matplotlib
